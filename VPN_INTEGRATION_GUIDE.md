# VPN Integration Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the VPN application architecture and integration points. It serves as a guide for completing the implementation and connecting to external services.

## Core Architecture

### 1. VPN Protocol Implementation

Our application uses WireGuard as the primary VPN protocol due to its simplicity, efficiency, and strong security characteristics. The implementation is structured as follows:

#### WireGuard Service (`src/services/wireguardService.ts`)
- Handles generation and management of WireGuard configurations
- Maintains connection state and statistics
- Provides interfaces for connecting, disconnecting, and monitoring
- Implements automatic reconnection on connection drops

#### DNS Leak Protection Service (`src/services/dnsService.ts`)
- Prevents DNS requests from bypassing the VPN tunnel
- Configures DNS servers to use secure providers
- Provides testing functionality to verify protection

#### Kill Switch Service (`src/services/killSwitchService.ts`)
- Blocks all internet traffic when VPN connection drops
- Integrates with platform-specific firewalls
- Provides graceful enabling/disabling functionality

### 2. API Service Layer

The API service layer (`src/services/apiService.ts`) provides a centralized interface for all backend communication:

- Authentication
- Server management
- Subscription and payment processing
- User profile and settings

This service implements caching, error handling, and request interception for token refresh.

### 3. State Management

Application state is managed through React Context:

- `VpnContext` - Manages VPN connection state and server selection
- `AuthContext` - Handles authentication state
- `SettingsContext` - Manages user preferences and settings

## Integration Points

### 1. Platform-Specific VPN Integration

The current implementation provides placeholder code for VPN integration. To complete the integration:

#### For Mobile (React Native):
1. Use native modules like `react-native-wireguard` to interface with platform VPN APIs
2. Implement secure storage using `react-native-keychain`
3. Configure DNS settings using native network APIs
4. Implement kill switch using native firewall APIs

#### For Desktop:
1. Use Electron's IPC to communicate with a native WireGuard implementation
2. Implement secure storage using the OS keychain/keystore
3. Configure DNS settings using OS network APIs
4. Implement kill switch using OS firewall APIs

#### For Web:
Web platforms have limited VPN capabilities due to browser restrictions. Consider:
1. Browser extension integration for true VPN functionality
2. WebRTC-based proxy solution (limited but feasible)
3. Server-side proxy with client-side configuration

### 2. Payment Integration

#### Stripe Integration (`src/components/payment/StripePayment.tsx`)
1. Create a Stripe account and obtain API keys
2. Implement a server endpoint for creating checkout sessions
3. Set up webhook handlers for payment events
4. Configure subscription plans in the Stripe dashboard

Implementation steps:
```javascript
// Server-side endpoint (Node.js example)
app.post('/create-checkout-session', async (req, res) => {
  const { planId } = req.body;
  
  // Create a checkout session
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    line_items: [{
      price: planId, // Price ID from Stripe dashboard
      quantity: 1,
    }],
    mode: 'subscription',
    success_url: `${YOUR_DOMAIN}/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
    cancel_url: `${YOUR_DOMAIN}/cancel`,
  });
  
  res.json({ url: session.url });
});
```

#### Cryptocurrency Integration (`src/components/payment/CryptoPayment.tsx`)
1. Create accounts with Coinbase Commerce or similar providers
2. Implement server endpoints for creating and checking payments
3. Set up webhook handlers for payment events

Implementation steps:
```javascript
// Server-side endpoint (Node.js example)
app.post('/create-crypto-payment', async (req, res) => {
  const { amount, description, currency } = req.body;
  
  // Create a charge using Coinbase Commerce API
  const charge = await coinbase.charges.create({
    name: description,
    description,
    pricing_type: 'fixed_price',
    local_price: {
      amount,
      currency: 'USD',
    },
    requested_info: [],
  });
  
  res.json({
    paymentId: charge.id,
    address: charge.addresses[currency],
    amount: charge.pricing[currency].amount,
  });
});
```

### 3. AdMob Integration (`src/components/ads/AdBanner.tsx`)

1. Create a Google AdMob account and set up ad units
2. Install the AdMob SDK:
   - For React Native: `react-native-google-mobile-ads`
   - For Web: Google Publisher Tags (GPT)
3. Configure ad units with your AdMob IDs

Implementation example:
```javascript
// Initialize AdMob
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const adScript = document.createElement('script');
  adScript.src = 'https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js';
  adScript.async = true;
  document.head.appendChild(adScript);
  
  window.googletag = window.googletag || { cmd: [] };
  googletag.cmd.push(function() {
    googletag.defineSlot('/YOUR_AD_UNIT_ID', [300, 250], 'ad-container')
      .addService(googletag.pubads());
    googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest();
    googletag.enableServices();
  });
});

// Display ad
googletag.cmd.push(function() {
  googletag.display('ad-container');
});
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Secure Storage

The application uses encryption for storing sensitive data:

- WireGuard configurations are encrypted before storage
- Authentication tokens are securely stored
- User preferences are stored with appropriate encryption

Recommendation: In production, use platform-specific secure storage:
- iOS: Keychain Services
- Android: Keystore
- Desktop: OS keychain/credential store
- Web: In-memory only, with refresh tokens

### 2. Network Security

- All API requests use HTTPS
- Certificate pinning should be implemented for API communication
- VPN tunnel integrity is verified

### 3. Input Validation

- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- API responses are validated against expected schemas
- Error handling is robust and doesn't expose sensitive information

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Bundle Size

- Code splitting is implemented for larger components
- Images are optimized
- Tree-shaking is enabled for unused code

### 2. Request Optimization

- API responses are cached where appropriate
- Polling intervals are optimized
- Network requests are batched where possible

### 3. Rendering Optimization

- React components are memoized where appropriate
- Lists use virtualization for large datasets
- Heavy computations are offloaded to web workers

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests

- Core business logic is unit tested
- Services have comprehensive test coverage
- UI components have snapshot tests

### 2. Integration Tests

- API interactions are tested with mock servers
- Component interactions are tested

### 3. End-to-End Tests

- Critical user flows are tested end-to-end
- VPN connection flows are tested
- Payment flows are tested with test accounts
